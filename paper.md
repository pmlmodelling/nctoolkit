# Summary

nctoolkit is a Python package for the analysis and post-processing of netCDF files. It provides a simple, intuitive interface, and includes a number of functions for common tasks such as subsetting, regridding, statistical analysis and plotting. The package is designed to be easy to use, and to require minimal code to perform common tasks. It is built on top of the Climate Data Operators (CDO)[@schulzweida_uwe_2022_7112925] library, which provides a powerful data model for working with multidimensional data. The underlying goal of the package is to provide comprehensive methods to climate, marine and atmospheric scientists working with netCDF data that will meet 80-100% of their typical processing requirements. 


# Statement of need

netCDF is a file format for storing multidimensional data, and it is the fundamental storage unit of most modelling and large-scale observational work carried out in climate, marine and atmospheric sciences. The format is self-describing, meaning that metadata is stored alongside the data, enabling computational methods to work for almost all netCDF files that follow suitable conventions. The scale and magnitude of netCDF data in use by scientists continues to grow rapdily. For example, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 [@ONeill2016], produced approximately 20 PB of publicly available data [@Petrie2021]. This accumulation of data offers great opportunies to environmental scientists, however it also poses challenges because analysis software is often difficult to use by non-specialists [@Bates2018] or is inadequate. nctoolkit is a Python package that aims to fill critical gaps in the current netCDF software ecosystem. It provides a clean interface for working with netCDF files, and it has a particular focus in ensuring the compatibility of methods with oceanic model output, which often have irregular vertical grids.


# Overview of Functionality 


nctoolkit's core object is the dataset, which is made up of netCDF files stored in a temporary location. Methods use the CDO library to perform operations on the dataset, and methods modify the datasets instead of returning new objects. Evaluation is lazy by default. This means that methods are only evaluated when necessary or when forced, which significantly improves performance. To ensure full functionality of nctoolkit, it is prefable that files analyzed follow the CF conventions [@Hassell2017].


The package's core functionality includes the following dataset methods: regridding (`regrid` and `to_latlon`), subsetting (`subset`), temporal statistics (`tmean`, `tmax` etc.), spatial statistics (`spatial_mean`, `spatial_max` etc.), vertical statistics and methods (`vertical_mean`, `vertical_interp`), plotting (`plot`, `pub_plot`), anomaly calculation (`annual_anomaly`), mathematical operations (`assign`) and ensemble statistics (`ensemble_mean` etc.). The package also includes a number of other methods for common tasks, including calculating the difference between two datasets(`ds1-ds2`), extracting the top layer of a dataset (`top`), and calculating the rolling mean (`rolling_mean`). The package also makes it easy to match gridded netCDF data to point observation data using the `match_points` method. 



# Example Use Case

This example shows how to calculate how much ocean temperatures have changed since the beginning of the 20th Century. The data used in this example is the NOAA COBE Sea Surface Temperature dataset [@Ishii2005], which is available from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory website at [https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cobe.html](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cobe.html). The data is stored in a netCDF file, which can be opened using the `open_data` function. This returns a `Dataset` object, which contains the data and metadata from the netCDF file. The `Dataset` object has a number of methods for working with the data, which can be used for manipulations and analysis. In this example, we first create a dataset which contains the average temperature for the years 1900-1919. We then calculate the average temperature for the years 2000-2019, and subtract the 1900-1919 average to calculate the change in temperature between the two periods. Finally, we plot the change in temperature using the `pub_plot` method, which generates a publication-quality plot. 


```python
import nctoolkit as nc

ds_clim = nc.open_data("sst.mon.mean.nc")

ds_clim.subset(years = range(1900, 1920))

ds_clim.tmean()

ds_present = nc.open_data("sst.mon.mean.nc")

ds_present.subset(years = range(2000, 2020))

ds_present.tmean()

ds_present-ds_clim

ds_present.pub_plot(title = "Change in sea surface temperature between 1900-19 and 2000-19 (Â°C)", legend = "")
```

# Development Notes

nctoolkit is developed on GitHub as an open-source package, and the authors welcome contributors and feature suggestions. We ensure the code's quality using an extensive suite of tests using the pytest module. Integration testing is carried out using GitHub Actions for both Linux and macOS. The package is tested on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11. The package is available on PyPI for Linux and macOS, and can be installed using pip. The package is also available on conda-forge for Linux, and can be installed using conda and mamba. The package is documented using Sphinx, and the documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs. The package is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.
